* The above visual depicts the most frequently occuring start and end times for bicycle rides in the city analysis. The visual indicates that approximately 8 AM in the mornings is the most frequent period for beginning a bicycle trip among users of the biycles in this city under review. This appears to hold true for the weekdays but not on the weekends. Additionally, the periods of 5 PM to 6 PM are also frequently associated with usage of hte citi bikes.

## Results

The data shows that the frequency of usage of bicycles by gender for a given urban location. Given the data, it may be adivsable to do the following:

* It appears that the most frequent usage times for the bicylces coincides with the morning rush hour and the evening rush hours. It may be advisable to construct a study of how the bicycles are comparing with other forms of transportation (IE: subway; vehicle; boat, etc). It may be the case that bicycle usage spikes during periods when other traditional forms of transportation are unavailable.
* It may also be advisable to consider using a similar study on bicycle usage within a different city. It is possible that the trends depicted in the analysis above exist only within the parameters of a given culture or urban environment.
